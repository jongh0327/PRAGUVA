221,Karina Rider,STS,"Karina researches how people think about ""good work"" in the digital age. Trained as a sociologist, they use qualitative methods -- such as ethnography, interviews, and discourse/content analysis -- to get at how people critique technology and labor, and how they try to fix it. They are currently writing a book for MIT Press that explores what happens when high-status tech workers in Silicon Valley become disillusioned with their jobs. The manuscript follows a group of engineers and computer scientists who volunteer in their spare time to build technologies for municipal governments as they try to simultaneously design technologies that increase civic participation while also working through their disappointment with the tech industry. Many workers find themselves in a bind: they want to feel passionate about their jobs in Silicon Valley, but the industry continuously disappoints them; they want to build things that will help people, but they are pressured to make their employer as much money as possible. Tech workers' frustration with their situation leads them to get involved in Tech for Good initiatives as a way to salve their discontentment. But this has consequences for the kinds of technologies Tech for Good initiatives create: often, they end up building products nobody uses, rather than helping the communities the volunteers wanted to assist in the first place. In all, the book tells a complicated story about passionate labor and the limits of Tech for Good projects."
