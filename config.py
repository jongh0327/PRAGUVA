Guidelines:
  - Read-only Cypher (MATCH/WHERE/RETURN/ORDER/LIMIT).
  - Prefer concise outputs (movie title, avg rating, counts).
  - If user asks for "similar movies to <title>", use co-rating pattern via users.
  - For actor queries, use (:Actor {name:'...'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie).
  - Default LIMIT 20 if not specified.
