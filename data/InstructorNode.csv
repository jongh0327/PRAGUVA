It is key to important cell signaling processes, which are the processes that convert extracellular cues, like growth factors and insulin, into biochemical networks that result in a change to the cell.  Tyrosine phosphorylation is specifically utilized in the early events of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) networks, which are fundamental to many processes in the development and homeostasis of complex organisms.  Improvements in measurement technologies have enabled the ability to detect and monitor tyrosine phosphorylation and now we know that tyrosine phosphorylation is extensive — occurring on thousands of tyrosines in the human proteome.","Research Communications Fellow, UVA 2023-2024, MAVEN Institute Senior Scientist 2023, UVA Research Achievement Award: Research Collaboration 2022, “Best of 2021” PLoS Computational Biology 2021, Outstanding Mentor and Ally Award, UVA Graduate BMES organization 2020, ,"

My research specifically focuses on advancing optimization and simulation methods used to inform the design and management of water resources systems with the goals of protecting people from nature (floods and droughts), and nature from people (pollution and consumption). I view this as an iterative process beginning with risk and uncertainty analysis to discover which sectors and populations are most vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic hazards, followed by multi-objective optimization of the system to reduce these multi-sectoral vulnerabilities. I am particularly interested in how advanced sensing and forecasting techniques can be used to inform this optimization.","Best Policy Oriented Paper Award, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 2024, UVA Civil Engineering Teaching Award, 2021, UVA Graduate Engineering Student Council Advisor of the Year, 2021, First Place, Universities Council on Water Resources (UCOWR) Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Natural Science and Engineering, 2017,"

The manuscript follows a group of engineers and computer scientists who volunteer in their spare time to build technologies for municipal governments as they try to simultaneously design technologies that increase civic participation while also working through their disappointment with the tech industry. Many workers find themselves in a bind: they want to feel passionate about their jobs in Silicon Valley, but the industry continuously disappoints them; they want to build things that will help people, but they are pressured to make their employer as much money as possible. Tech workers' frustration with their situation leads them to get involved in Tech for Good initiatives as a way to salve their discontentment. But this has consequences for the kinds of technologies Tech for Good initiatives create: often, they end up building products nobody uses, rather than helping the communities the volunteers wanted to assist in the first place.

My father was a mathematics teacher and from my childhood, I always remember how he influenced my mind indirectly to have a passion for teaching. So, I was fortunate to gain a perspective on teaching in the early stages of my childhood. He always reminded me of how teaching is crucial for society and my mindset has been framed by a saying he often shared with me:” No matter what you are teaching, always be careful how you behave with your students. They are next-generation and whatever you teach will be reflected in your society. So, teaching is not merely a simple job, it is the foundation of a society and if you build it well, it will be improved gradually”.","M.Sc.
